There's no lesson for this session. In your exercise this week you'll export a plot from ggplot, open it in a [vector editing pregram](/resource/graphics-editors.html), and make it extra pretty and well-designed. The best way to learn this is by actually doing it.

So head over to [the example](/example/14-example.qmd) to see how it's done, or [the exercise](/assignment/14-exercise.qmd) to get started!
