There's no lesson for this session. In your exercise this week you'll export a plot from ggplot, open it in a vector editor like [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Gravit Designer](https://www.designer.io/en/), and make it extra pretty and well-designed. The best way to learn this is by actually doing it.

So head over to [the example](/example/14-example.qmd) to see how it's done, or [the exercise](/assignment/14-exercise.qmd) to get started!
