There's no lesson for this session. In your exercise this week you'll visualize text data using [{tidytext}](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), and the best way to figure that out is to just play with data.

So head over to [the example](/example/13-example.qmd) to see how it's done, or [the exercise](/assignment/13-exercise.qmd) to get started!
